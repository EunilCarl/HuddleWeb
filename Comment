Hi its Eunil of course, This is my 4th repository and also my 3rd responsive Website

Programming Languages that I Learned and will Learn:
I Learned Java, Python and C++ and I want to learn javascript next

I recently got interested after finding out frameworks, i didn't know that you can use frameworks to save time
so i got interested in learning javascript for my next language
welp its almost february and next week is our exam wish me luck

i bought books about history because i might think i will use it in the future
my anxiety is still kicking in and i still can't fix myself will i still continue
with my life being the same or someday i will change like someone new?
who knows, we cannot predict it. Anyways that's all, I hope you're reading this future me.
